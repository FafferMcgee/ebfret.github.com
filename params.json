{"name":"ebFRET","tagline":"ebFRET performs combined analysis on multiple single-molecule FRET time series to learn a set of rates and states ","body":"### Consensus analysis of many single-molecule FRET time series\r\n\r\nebFRET is a library written in Matlab for the analysis of single-molecule FRET time series with hidden Markov models. \r\n\r\n![Example Traces](https://raw.github.com/ebfret/paper-icml/master/figures/fig_example_traces_500dpi.png)\r\n\r\nIt is the successor of [vbFRET](http://vbfret.sourceforge.net), which it improves upon by performing combined analysis of multiple time series at once. This approach, known as _empirical Bayes_, is both more accurate and statistically robust. It also enables more advanced analysis use cases such as sub-population detection.\r\n\r\n![Inference Accuracy](https://raw.github.com/ebfret/paper-icml/master/figures/fig_accuracy_vs_noise_v2_500dpi.png)\r\n\r\n### Get the Source\r\n\r\nThe ebFRET source code (with graphical user interface) can be downloaded here [[git](https://github.com/ebfret/ebfret-gui); [zip](https://github.com/ebfret/ebfret-gui/archive/master.zip)]. Please see README for installation instructions. The legacy command-line version of ebFRET is still available as well [[git](https://github.com/ebfret/ebfret-legacy); [zip](https://github.com/ebfret/ebfret-legacy/archive/master.zip)].\r\n\r\n### Read the Paper\r\n\r\n_``Hierarchically-coupled hidden Markov models for learning kinetic rates from single-molecule data.''_\r\nJan-Willem van de Meent (@jwvdm), Jonathan Bronson, Frank Wood, Ruben Gonzalez, Chris Wiggins.
