This approach, known as _empirical Bayes_, is both more accurate and statistically robust. It also enables more advanced analysis use cases such as sub-population detection.\r\n\r\n### Read the Paper\r\n\r\n_Hierarchically-coupled hidden Markov models for learning kinetic rates from single-molecule data._\r\nJan-Willem van de Meent (@jwvdm), Jonathan Bronson, Frank Wood, Ruben Gonzalez, Chris Wiggins (@chrishwiggins)\r\n[[pdf]](https://github.com/ebfret/paper)\r\n\r\n### Example Usage\r\n```\r\ndata = load_fret('my_data.dat')\r\neb = eb_fret(data.fret, [2,3,4], 10);\r\ntracePlotter(data.fret, 'vit', eb.vit);\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
